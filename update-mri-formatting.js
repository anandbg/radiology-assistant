CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS based on the provided template example:
1. Use clean, professional section headers without bold markdown
2. For lumbar disc findings, use detailed bullet points with "- At L#-#" format
3. Include specific nerve impingement details (traversing vs exiting nerves)
4. Use medical terminology precisely (thecal sac, ligamentum flavum, etc.)
5. Apply macro replacements naturally in context
6. Format conclusions with bullet-pointed key findings
7. Include professional closing statement

EXAMPLE OUTPUT STYLE:
