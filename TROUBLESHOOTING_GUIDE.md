## 📞 LAST RESORT:

If you're still having issues after trying all the above, the problem is likely:
1. **Network/Firewall blocking external CDN resources** (Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome, Axios)
2. **Corporate proxy interfering with JavaScript execution**
3. **Antivirus software blocking web app functionality**
4. **Browser in compatibility mode or very outdated version**

Try accessing from a different network (mobile hotspot) or device to confirm.
